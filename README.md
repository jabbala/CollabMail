## Workflow and Approval Process
CollabMail introduces a powerful workflow and approval process module that enhances team collaboration and decision-making. Here's how it works:
- Workflow Templates: Admins can define custom workflow templates that outline a sequence of steps, roles, and actions. For instance, a "Document Approval" template might involve stages like "Draft Review," "Manager Approval," and "Final Review."
- Initiating Workflows: Users can initiate workflows within mail groups. For instance, a user can initiate the "Document Approval" workflow by uploading a document and selecting the appropriate workflow template.
- Role-Based Actions: Each workflow stage involves role-based actions. Users with the required role can perform actions such as reviewing, approving, or rejecting.
- Real-time Notifications: The mail notification engine generates real-time email notifications for workflow tasks, ensuring immediate awareness and action.
- Transparent Tracking: Detailed history and tracking of workflow actions enhance transparency and accountability.

## Mail Notification Engine
The Mail Notification Engine enhances CollabMail Pro by providing automatic email notifications for various events:

- New mail group invitations
- Workflow initiation and task assignments
- Workflow stage transitions
- Workflow approval or rejection
- Important email arrivals

Notifications are sent to relevant users, ensuring that team members are informed and engaged throughout the collaboration process.
